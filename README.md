EduApps Chrome Extension
=========================

Basically this embeds the edu-apps.org
interface into various LMSs to make it easier to
configure LTI apps that are available on that site.

Right now it's been configured to work in:

- Canvas
- Moodle
- CourseSites (Blackboard)

To try it out, load the .crx file in Chrome to 
install the extension. Do this by going to Tools -> Extensions
and then dragging and dropping the .crx file onto
that page.

Then go to the LTI config
page in a supported LMS and watch the magic happen.
