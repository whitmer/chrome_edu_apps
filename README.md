EduApps Chrome Extension
=========================

Right now this is Moodle and Canvas-only. I'll be adding more
LMSs as we go. Basically this embeds the edu-apps.org
interface into various LMSs to make it easier to
configure LTI apps that are available on that site.

To try it out, load the .crx file in Chrome to 
install the extension. Do this by going to Tools -> Extensions
and then dragging and dropping the .crx file onto
that page.

Then go to the LTI config
page in a supported LMS and watch the magic happen.
